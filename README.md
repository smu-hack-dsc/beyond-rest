# Beyond RESTful Workshop 2024

### Overview

Most of our students are aware of RESTful APIs. The 6th Tech Team aims to provide a broader view of other communication protocols that can be used in different use cases that can support the application in ways that RESTful APIs cannot. This is an introductory workshop that aims to provide our participants a strong foundation on WebSockets and gRPC, two communication protocols that we have identified to be crucial in the current web development landscape.

### Usage

This repository is used for Beyond RESTful 2024 participants to follow along during the workshop. The repository is split into WebSocket and gRPC. In its own folder, there are its own README that guides the participants on how to run the code.

### Contribution

A huge thanks to [Joen Tan](https://github.com/Joentze), [Kaung Nyan Lin](https://github.com/darkliyznyanlin910) and [Sean Yap](https://github.com/S3annnyyy) for teaching WebSocket and gRPC respectively. They have put in their time and effort into polishing their relevant skills, compiled slides and wrote the above scripts for the participants' understanding. This workshop would not have been a successful without them.
